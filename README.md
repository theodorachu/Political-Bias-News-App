First hackathon at Treehacks 2015 from Feb. 20-22. Team members consisted of Jordan Duprey and me. We wanted to make a news app that would show political news articles. People can then vote on the political bias of an article - right, left, or moderate - and based on those votes, articles with the most "moderate" views would be ranked at the top. As it was our first time at a hackathon and our first time using Android development, we ran into some issues with figuring out how to create a database that could store people's votes, so we ended up scaling it down so that the app would track only your own votes to make you more aware of whether you were reading about debates from both sides. It was a lot of fun to get a chance to learn something new and get to feel the adrenaline of a hackathon!
